            <h1>Italian Marinated Flank Steak</h1>
            <h3>Published on September 14, 2017</h3>
            <h2>Make your taste-buds sizzle with this juicy steak recipe!</h2>
            <p>Everyone knows that when it comes to food, steak is one of the most luxurious and juicy of the meats (depending on how you cook it, of course). As much as we at Carne / Marinata love to grill our meats, we realize that not everyone has access to a grill. Here’s a recipe for steak that you can cook in your oven, rather than on the grill, and still keep your meat juicy and full of flavor.</p>

                        </ul>

                    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>3 tsp minced garlic</li>
                            <li>1 Tbsp rosemary leaves</li>
                            <li>1 Tbsp dried oregano</li>
                            <li>2 Tbsp stone-ground mustard</li>
                            <li>1/2 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
                            <li>1 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                            <li>Salt</li>
                            <li>Pepper</li>

                        </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="col-middle">
                    <h2>Steps:</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>In your food processor or blender, combine the garlic, rosemary, oregano, mustard, and vinegar and puree the mixture. Then, gradually add in the oil, blending as you go, until the mixture is creamy. Season the vinaigrette lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
                            <li>Put the meat in your glass baking dish and pour all but ¼ cup of the vinaigrette on top of the meat. Turn the meat a few times to coat it thoroughly. Cover the dish with plastic-wrap and refrigerate for 4-24 hours.</li>
                            <li>Once the meat has had some time to marinate, set your oven to broil on its high setting. While your oven preheats, remove the meat from the dish and place it on the cutting board, letting the excess marinade drip off the meat into the glass dish. Rub the marinade into the meat on all sides, and then use paper towels to pat the meat dry of any excess marinade.</li>
                            <li>Place the meat on your grated broiler pan, and put it on a rack in the middle of the oven. Allow the meat to broil for 5 1/2 minutes before turning, and then let it cook for another 5 1/2 minutes on the other side. Check the temperature of the meat with your meat thermometer. We want it to be at least 160°F (medium-rare) before we take it out of the oven. If a core temperature of 160°F has not been achieved after 11 minutes in the oven, let it cook longer, checking every few minutes with the thermometer and turning it periodically until 160°F or higher has been reached.</li>
                            <li>While the meat is cooking, pour the remaining ¼ cup vinaigrette from earlier (before we marinated the steak) into a saucepan and allow it to simmer on the stove on low until it is hot.</li>
                            <li>Once the meat has been cooked to your liking, remove it from the oven and put it on a clean cutting board and allow the meat to rest for at least 3 minutes to prevent losing the juice inside the meat. After resting, cut the meat across the grain (across the width). Plate the meat, drizzle the heated vinaigrette onto the steak, and serve.</li>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember to finish your mise en place (everything in place) before you start cooking to save time and stress throughout the process.</li>
                    <li>Remember to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water before and after touching raw meat, including during the process when you need to touch other utensils.</li>
                    <li>This dish was prepared with the chef’s preferences in mind, if you want your steak cooked more, look up the correct cooking time for how you want it prepared.</li>
                    <li>For flank steak, it is best prepared medium-rare or medium. Cook it further at your own risk, after medium it will begin to turn tough and lose juice due to the type of steak it is.</li>
                    <li>Always make sure to store raw meat in a sealed, clean container on the bottom shelf of your fridge to ensure it will not drip or touch other foods.</li>
